## Problem & Customer Need <a name="problem"></a>

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Travelling by airplane is one of the fastest and most convenient ways to journey along long distances. To make flights as secure as possible, frequent maintenance is needed. As a vital part of the airplane, engines must go through maintenance either after a certain amount of flight hours or if damages occur.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
To conduct the maintenance, the airplane engine has to be dissassembled into all its parts. Thereafter, every part is checked, cleaned, fixed or replaced. Finally, the engine is reassembled and thoroughly tested. However, **75%** of all airplane engine test after maintenance fail due to leakages of air, oil or fuel. Most of these leakages are caused by human error during assembly. The four most common sources of these human errors are:
* missed steps or steps done wrong during reassembly
* use of wrong parts or configurations
* use of damaged parts (e.g. damaged sealings)
* contamination of parts or surfaces (e.g. by dirt or lint)

{: style="text-align: justify" }
These failed tests are very costly to enigne maintenance providers like MTU Maintenance due to a number of reasons. The three most impactful ones are:
* testing an engine takes up valuable time in the testing cells. 
* if the engine fails a test it must be dissassembled, checked and reassembled again- this may take up to two shifts time and it is not ensured that further error can be prevented while reassembling the engine for the second time
* failed tests are an environmental hazard: during the test, real resources like oil and fuel are being used. If an eninge fails the test, these resources are wasted.

## Our Solution <a name="solution"></a>

{: style="text-align: justify" }
We provide a digital and smart solution, that is especially tailored to fit the needs of airplane engine maintenance providers. Our App can be used to  track the work done by mechanics, make the specific worksteps more comprehensible, collect data on issues and raise awareness about difficult tasks. Team Leads are able to assigne tasks quickly and plan workloads and resource occupations accordingly. This will enable teams to track their work progress in real-time. 

{: style="text-align: justify" }
With our App, we provide mechanics with all the details they need to know and track assembly progress to identify mistakes while they are being made. Hence, airplane enigne assembly will become more efficient. Human error as well as common problems like leakages of oil, fuel or air will be minimized and  errors during assembly will be reduced.

![Have a glimpse into our App!](/assets/img/app_mockup1.png){:class="displayed"}

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Our App compromises 6 key features to guarantee ease of use and the best support possible during maintenance:
* *Smart and Mobile*: Our App can be used on any mobile device and is a multi-facetted and convenient platform for the engineers to use directly at their workstation. We include a knowledge hub to collect all information about steps and make smart assignment of open tasks to the next free resource possible
* *Digital*: we significantly reduce the amount of paper used and shift all documentation to our digitzed platform
* *Data Collection & Feedback*: we can track which steps and parts have caused issues in the past. This enables us to statistically analyze the assembly and give warnings to mechanics for the most critical steps
* Comprehensible: The app is easy to understand and use and will not create any additional workload compared to the previous paper documentation
* *Task Facilitation*: our first language will be german as most engineers speak german as their mother language. The app will give engineers a clear overview over their tasks, all in one place, and will assist throughout tasks with references to mastercards and tips for completing the steps
* *Task Validation*: every mechanic has to confirm the work he has done after finalization of a step

## Customer Value Proposition <a name="cvp"></a>

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Our platform enables customers to digitally track their maintenance and the processes involved in real-time. We are able to provide mechanics with integrated feedback and maintenance manual instructions for checklists and are able to collect data while doing so. 

{: style="text-align: justify" }
AirCare is a unique digital solution in the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) Segment of Enigine Maintenance. We can guarantee that the human error factor during assembly is minimized by providing a unique combination of three key benefits:

#### Our Unique Selling Point
![Our Unique Selling Point](/assets/img/USP.png){:class="displayed"}

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Firstly, we can eliminate knowledge of mechanics that might occur during assembly by integrating the assembly instructions in the form of mastercards directly into the tasks in AirCare's workflow. If the mechanics proceed to the next task, they will recive reminders about critical steps and all information needed to complete the task in the best way possible. If a mechanic wants to access more information, they can always have a look into the mastercard which is also linked to the specific steps. This ensures a high standard of task completion, while also reminding mechanics of the features of a task. In case a mastercard is updated, AirCare will automatically remind the enigneer to have look at the changes.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Secondly, we support mechanics in the correct completion of repetitive tasks. Completing a task can be like riding a bike: The more often you do it, the more it becomes "muscle memory" and the easier it is to just do it without thinking about the specific steps involved. However during enigne maintenance, it is critical that the engineer stays focussed. With AirCare, we include small check ins and little quizzes to ensure that maintenance never gets boring for the mechanics.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Thirdly, the mixup of Parts and Instructions will be reduced with the use of AirCare. If a part is very similar to another part, we will show pictures to emphasize which part and hich specifc configuration to use. In the future, this will become even more hassle free: AI sensors will be able to scan the part directly from the app, to confirm that the right part is used. For the Instructions we follow a similar approach: The right instructions steps will be directly linked to a task, so that the mechanic will not have to spend any time on finding the right page in a lengthy manual.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
By controlling the processes and operations as well as granting a comprehensible and easy way of ensuring the right steps or the maintenance process are completed, our customer save time and resources. AirCare makes can ensure, that errors during assembly are minimized. Thereby we increase the rate of successfull tests after maintenance. This means that the resources used during the test, oil, fuel and air, are used meaningfully and not wasted. And best of all, by being a digital solution and drastically reducing the amount of paper in the workshop, we are also environmentally friendly!
